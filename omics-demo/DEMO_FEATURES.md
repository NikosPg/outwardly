## Marketing Copy Ideas

### Email Campaigns
"See bioinformatics analysis come to life - try our interactive RNA-seq demo"

### Social Media
"🧬 Just launched: Interactive omics demo! Explore RNA-seq results in your browser."

### Conference Presentations
"Visit ekfansis.com/omics-demo to see our platform in action"

### Cold Outreach
"Unlike typical bioinformatics consultants, we build interactive web applications. Here's a live demo: [link]"

---

## ROI for Client

If we charge €20k for a custom platform, the demo shows:
- What the UI will look like
- How interactive it will be
- What kind of visualizations they'll get
- That we can deliver production code

This reduces "buyer anxiety" and increases conversion rate.

---

## Maintenance & Updates

### Easy to Update
Because it's a Next.js app:
- Add new visualizations easily
- Update sample data
- Add more tabs/features
- A/B test different designs

### Future Additions (Low Effort)
