- Proteomics quantification

### 2. Data Engineering & Storage

We design scalable data infrastructure:
- **PostgreSQL** or **DuckDB** for metadata storage
- Efficient indexing and querying of omics results
- ETL pipelines for data integration
- Cloud storage solutions (AWS S3, Azure Blob)
- Data versioning and provenance tracking

### 3. Statistical Analysis & Machine Learning

Advanced analytics tailored to your research:
- Differential expression analysis
- Pathway enrichment (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
- Predictive modeling (classification, regression)
- Deep learning for sequence analysis
